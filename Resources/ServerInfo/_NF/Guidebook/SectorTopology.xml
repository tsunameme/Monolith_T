# Sector Topology

<!-- Note: range values will not scale with the world size cvar! -->

The Colossus Sector consists of a large, disk-like asteroid belt. In the center of the belt, Colossus Central serves as the arrival point for greenhorns and seasoned pilgrims alike.

The area immediately around Colossus Central is mostly empty space. Beyond this, there are [bold]four distinct zones[/bold]:

- The [color=#c73232]inner ring[/color] ([color=gold]≤5 km[/color]) has been developed into a base for service stations like [color=forestgreen]Trade Outpost[/color] and [color=mediumturquoise]Medical Dispatch[/color]. You can still find errant scrap, small asteroids, and the occasional wreck, but better materials are found further out. At the edge of this zone, you'll find [color=green]Cargo Depots[/color], the destination for most cargo freighters.
- The [color=#fbf236]middle ring[/color] ([color=gold]~5–9 km[/color]) is the foundation for our industrial base. With a wide variety of [color=orchid]minerals[/color] available for mining and a variety of [color=lightpink]gas deposits[/color] available for drilling, this is a [color=peru]miner's[/color] breadbasket.
- The [color=#286c9c]outer ring[/color] ([color=gold]~9–20 km[/color]) is where you'll find massive [color=skyblue]icy asteroids[/color] and unusual [color=orange]brass wrecks[/color]. This ring is the subject of interest for most [color=plum]researchers[/color] in the sector.
- The [color=#af0f0f]far ring[/color] ([color=gold]20+ km[/color]) is [color=red]not well-studied[/color]. Encounters with unknown ships have been reported.

Beyond this, the far ring continues indefinitely. Travellers entering this zone without sufficient preparation and means of threat management risk never returning again.
