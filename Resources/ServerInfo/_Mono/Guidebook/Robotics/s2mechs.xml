  # Series 2 Combat Mechs

  An expensive and adaptable selection, the S2 Armored Frames provide a stronger and faster combat platform compared to S1 mechs but find it difficult to maneuver indoors.

  All S2 mechs are space insulated and provide breathable atmosphere, but the Sabre lacks maneuvering jets.

##Broadsword

The Broadsword is the standard S2 platform, capable of mounting "Light" mech weapons. It moves very fast in space, and is primarily useful for contesting lighter combat frames and spaceborn infantry.

##Halberd

The Halberd is a variant of the Broadsword, sacrificing some Armor and Speed for the ability to mount "Medium" mech weapons. It is still capable of moving fast in space, but is no longer able to outrun some ships.

##Sabre

The Sabre is a variant of the Broadsword, sacrificing much of its Armor and its maneuvering jets for the ability to operate under Gravity, particularly on Planets, as well as the ability to mount "Medium" mech weapons.
