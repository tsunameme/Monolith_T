  "The Motley Anne is a mobile dockyard manufactured on demand by the House Ikarus's Economic Divisions military production line for Vanguard use. It provides a closer back line for engagements in order to safely and quickly resupply.

IED's expert logistics sector has determined that in order to produce the Motley efficiently, rather than expending military salaries, resource quotas must be met to make up for the dip in labor and supply costs."
