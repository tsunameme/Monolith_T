# Core Rule 6.
## Do not abuse the Admin Help System.

Before reading below, please note this rule does not apply to requests of fixing bugs such as being stuck in walls or requesting mentorship on topics such as "How do I do x?" or "What is y?"

Monolith is an MRP server where gods that grant people 50 joints don't usually exist when players magically use the "Ahelp" button.

There are IC alternatives that admins get alerted of (Prayers, Genie lamps, Phones, etc.) when you use them, and they should be used when making IC requests such as spawning clothes.

If the items requested are not spawned for you, don't take it as permission to ahelp asking if any admins are on to take your prayer.
