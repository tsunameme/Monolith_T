# Core Rule 6.
## Do not abuse the Admin Help System.

[italic][color=green]Before reading below, please note this rule does not apply to requests of fixing bugs such as being stuck in walls or requesting mentorship on topics such as "How do I do x?" or "What is y?"[/color][/italic]

- Monolith is an MRP server where gods that grant people 3 wishes when summoned don't usually exist when players magically use the "Ahelp" button.

- There are [color=green]IC alternatives[/color] that admins get alerted of [color=yellow](Prayers, Genie lamps, Phones, etc.)[/color] when you use them, and they should be used when making IC requests such as spawning clothes.

-- If the items requested are not spawned for you, [color=red]don't[/color] take it as permission to ahelp asking if any admins are on to take your prayer.

- This rule also covers situations such as spamming, flooding with text, or arguing in the admin help window.
