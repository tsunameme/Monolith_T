# Conflict Rule 3
## Engage in fair play when making demands.

- Players must be given a reasonable time ([color=yellow][bold]at least 10 seconds[/bold][/color]) to react to demands before capture, serious injury, or death is inflicted in [bold]less-intense[/bold] conflict such as between Civilians and Factions/other Civilians.
- All demands must be made in [color=yellow]English[/color] so they are clearly understood by all parties.
- Use [color=green]roleplay[/color] and [color=green]escalation[/color]; avoid making impossible or unclear demands.
- Shipgun usage during [color=red]piracy[/color] should be a last resort, boarding methods should be prioritized and EMP's can be utilized to assist in boarding.
