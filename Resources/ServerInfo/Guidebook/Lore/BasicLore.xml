# The Colossus Sector
[bold]The Colossus Sector[/bold] is a remote and volatile region at the edge of the [bold]Perseus Arm[/bold], once dismissed by
the galactic powers as being the abandoned carcass of syndicate controlled space. For decades, the colossus served as the galactic fringe where separatist enclaves dominated it's ecosystem — a cosmic oubliette where the forgotten reside. However the sector did not fade into the radiation of night. It adapted, giving way for a nation to arise.
A feudal-esque society of the colossus, cultivated from the discarded remains of the syndicate corporation: The [bold][color=#D2B48C]Phaethon Dynasty[/bold][/color].

 # The Monolith
At the heart of [bold]The Colossus Sector[/bold] lies the [bold][color=047ABD]Monolith[/bold][/color], an immense and anomoulous region
deep within colossus space. Its origin and phenomena remains unclear, but its strange energy readings, unstable geographic stability, abundance of rare resources and
resistance to modern analysis have made it the obsession of every major galactic power. Found by the [bold][color=#D2B48C]Phaethon Dynasty[/bold][/color], it's existence was originally a safeguarded secret that was essential for growth of the enclaved nation. The Inevitable discovery of the [bold][color=047ABD]Monolith[/bold][/color]
transformed the sector from irrelevant to strategic — sparking the latest war for control of its secrets.

# Factions
[bold]The Colossus Sector[/bold] teeters on the edge of open war. While the [bold][color=cyan]Trans-Solarian Federation (TSF)[/bold][/color] publicly claim to seek “stabilization” of the region, covert fleets and special operations units under the guise of research and peacekeeping are deployed.
Tensions flare daily over disputed zones with colossus inhabitants and keen prospectors alike, with skirmishes erupting over unclaimed colossus space. Meanwhile, the [bold][color=#D2B48C]Phaethon Dynasty[/bold][/color] fortifies its borders, preparing for the inevitable clash with the Trans-Solarian Federation, employing and funding insurgency cells to quell and push back Federation forces from the Monolith.
Sabotage, propaganda floods, and deep-cover infiltration has escalated across the sector. Diplomacy is not option, warships loom in position in deadspace,
a full-scale war looms — one that could spiral far beyond the sector and ignite a
new galactic crisis.
